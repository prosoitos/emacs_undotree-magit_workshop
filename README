** What is emacs?

Emacs is a powerful extensible and highly customizable text editor.

** How can it be useful to me?

It is a great tool to:

- write/run code (Python, R, etc.)
- write scripts
- literate programming
- version control (e.g. Git)
- write in LaTeX/html/etc.
- agenda
- notes
- emails
- ...

** Goal of this workshop

The idea is to:

1. give you a feel for the potential emacs
2. get you started in your emacs journey so that you can easily look up information and build the knowledge on your own

This workshop will *not* cover points in detail. We will move along fast and you might not be able to follow on your computer. But by the end, you will better be able to assess whether it is a tool you want to learn and if so, you will know how to do this by yourself.

** Plan for the day

- [[http://www.dr-qubit.org/undo-tree.html][undo-tree]]: a package allowing unlimited undo and redo without ever breaking the chain thanks to its tree (rather than linear) structure

- [[https://github.com/magit/magit][magit]]: a package to run git in emacs

[[https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4634851/29159047-1ad89144-7d62-11e7-9c63-d1793339797b.png]]

- [[http://ess.r-project.org/][ESS]]: a package to run statistical analysis programs, including R, in emacs

- Babel: literate programming in org-mode (org-mode is part of emacs by default)

If we can't cover all of it, I will be happy to give a follow-up workshop at a later date.

** Who is this workshop for?

This workshop is open to anyone. While you do not need any prior knowledge of emacs, it would be most useful if you had some level of familiarity with some of these tools ("tool" being used in a very broad sense here...):

- git
- R
- RMarkdown

Not only will it make understanding of what we are doing easier, it will also give you an opportunity to see how one can do some of the tasks you are familiar with in emacs. Even if you end up not embracing emacs, it could broaden your perspective on some of these tasks and the tools you use.

That said, anybody curious about emacs is welcome! You can always learn something new, even if you don't follow everything! Just be aware that I might not be able to help you get started on your computer if things are too unfamiliar to you.
